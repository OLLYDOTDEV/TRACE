**Project Overview** 

**Problem / Aim**
Having the right equipment for the job can be the difference between a task being trivail or near imposable.  Creating tapered swept wings with more traditional techniques (such as a tension bow ) is one of them. This project aims at creating the right equipment that to expand the range of manufacturable wing designs/airfoils for the client with a focus on thermal regulation.

**Context**
As it stand for the client their current equipment imposes limitations of the wing designs/airfoils that are achievable to manufacturer practically. TRACE takes the form of a 4-axis foam wire cutter that will enable the manufacturer of low-cost and fast production while maintaining repeatability and precision.


**Research**
To ensure a high equality outcome will involve conducting research on 

GRBL Generation from designs 
Control hardware
Linear axis hardware.
Stepper Motor selection 
Power requirements 
Kurf size
Thermal PID control 
Thermocouples








**Project Methodology**
Project execution method 
The project management style will consist of an “Agile” methodology to allow for a flexible and iterative design and build progress where its a continuous cycle. This consists of 
Requirements > Design > Development > Testing > Deployment > Repeat
**Measurable data points**

Wire temperature / Power dissipation 
Degree of precision of model replication
Speed / Feed rate 
Position step size

Technical literacy sources / Data Sources**

 Online forums / open source repositories  for initial design 
Technical documentation  / Textbook for parameterized calculations
